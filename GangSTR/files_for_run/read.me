Hi Mikhail,
I got a gangstr reference from you a while back for hg38, do you have the scripts that you used to generate it?

Hi Nima. Yes, I believe I used /storage/mikhail/080819_mouse_human_rat_STR_summary/13_run_filter_hg38.sh and /storage/mikhail/080819_mouse_human_rat_STR_summary/filter_TRF_wHpol.py

Input .bed file came from /storage/nmmsv/reference_TRF/raw/raw_ref_grch38_20bp_XY.bed

Hope you can see those files. I chmod -R 775 on the folder
